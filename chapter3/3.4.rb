# In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of di erent sizeswhichcanslideontoanytower Thepuzzlestartswithdiskssortedinascending order of size from top to bottom (e g , each disk sits on top of an even larger one) You have the following constraints:
# (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time
# (B) A disk is slid o  the top of one rod onto the next rod
# (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk
# Write a program to move the disks from the  rst rod to the last using Stacks
